        1. Create new project in VS
        2. Choose ASP.net web application (C#)
        3. Select MVC template and choose no authentication
        4. Choose to save this project in a folder linked to a Github repo.
     B. Working with the MVC
        1. Controllers: The user interacts with the controller which manipulates the model which changes the view the user sees.
        2. Actions tell the controller which view to serve.

|Assignment for next week
  [  A. Everyone should create a controller called contacts.
         -This controller should return a view displaying an individual contact. The route should determine which contact is being pulled up. 
         -Hint: Routes go Controller\Action\ID. The action is technically the same (ViewContactInformation?), but the ID is different (Jimmy vs Billy).
     B. Style your page for extra bonus points.
     C. Submit to your personal Github Repo by Wednesday 4/12 11:59PM.
     D. Prepare to present your homework during next class.
